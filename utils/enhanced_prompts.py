CRITICAL CHARACTER CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
The main character MUST maintain EXACT consistency with:
- Physical Appearance: {appearance}
- Facial Features: {facial_features}
- Clothing: {clothing}
- Distinctive Features: {distinctive_features}
- Body Type and Posture: {body_type}
- Hair Style and Color: {hair_details}

ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. The character's face, body proportions, and clothing MUST remain IDENTICAL
2. NO changes to hair color, style, or length
3. NO changes to clothing items or colors
4. NO changes to skin tone or facial structure
5. The character should appear as if filmed in continuous footage

REFERENCE ANCHORS:
- This is the SAME person continuing the SAME action
- Think of this as the next few seconds of footage of the EXACT same person
- Any deviation from the character's appearance is a FAILURE
